/**
 * The purpose of Effects is to timely alter the state or value of attributes of
 * selected elements of the context, specified on the "selector"
 * property of theirs.
 *
 * The attributes of the elements that the Effect manipulates are 
 * always defined on the attrs.animatedAttrs object, passed to it on its constructor. 
 * Each key of this object corresponds to an attribute that the Effect will alter and the value
 * of each specifies the final value to go to.
 * On runtime, each Effect is analysed first by element and secondly 
 * by animatedAttr. 
 * For example an Effect that has the selector ".my-class",
 * that applies in two elements of the context, and has two animatedAttrs 
 * will be analysed into four in total "MonoIncidents" (2 elements * 2 animatedAttrs).
 * Each of these produced MonoIncidents refer to a very specific element and
 * to a very specific animated attribute.
 * The Class that you are defining here extends Effect which represents exactly this MonoIncident.
 * 
 * Thus, here you'll find:
 * the following properties:
 * - this.element: provides a reference to the specific element of the MonoIncident
 * - this.attributeKey: the key of the animatedAttr of the MonoIncident
 * - this.targetValue: the final value of the animatedAttr
 * - this.initialValue: the initial value of the animatedAttr
 * and the following methods:
 * - onGetContext
 * - getScratchValue
 * - onProgress
 * which are analysed more inline
 *
